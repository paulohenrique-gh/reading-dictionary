# Reading Dictionary

## Language: Java

A simple application that helps keeping track of characters and other terms in a book.
It loads a local file "new_dictionary.csv" that contains the previously saved entries.

This project was made to consolidate some of the knowledge gained from studying Java for the past few months.
Some concepts involved:
- General object-oriented programming principals
- Operations with arrays, lists and maps
- The StringBuilder class
- File input/output
